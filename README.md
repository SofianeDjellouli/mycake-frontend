# How to run it

1. To install the packages, first run `yarn` in the folder of the project.

2. Then, to run it in dev mode use `yarn start`. To run it in production mode use `yarn docker-start` (you will need to have Docker running on your machine) then open your local host at port 8080. Chrome is recommanded for a better experience.

Please note that in dev mode, hot updates are not working because I'm overriding the window.Promise object. You will need to reload the page manually to see the changes.
