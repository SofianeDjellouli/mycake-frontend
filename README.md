This project was created with Create React App, Material-UI Firebase and Nginx.

To install the packages, first run `yarn` in the folder of the project.

Then, to run it in dev mode use `yarn start`, or to run it in prod mode use `yarn docker-start` (you will need to have Docker running on your machine for that).

Please note that in dev mode, hot updates are not working because I'm overriding the window.Promise object. You will need to reload the page to see the changes.
